<br><br>
Welcome to DIMUN VIII! It is with great honour that I will be serving this conference as your Secretary-General Emeritus. Whether you are a seasoned diplomat or completely new to MUN, this conference will provide a completely new experience for everyone – DIMUN conferences are more than just a place for intellectual sparring, they are gatherings where students forge bonds with one another and create treasured memories that stay with them throughout their MUN career.

																						Since I entered the MUN community four years ago, I have been to numerous conferences as an admin, a delegate, a chair and as a Secretary-General. These powerful experiences have helped me foster a growing appreciation for this subject and I hope that DIMUN will positively impact you in many ways. Indeed, I am confident that this year’s team will give you ample opportunity to make the most of DIMUN VIII. </p>

It is my upmost honoured to serve as your Secretary-General for DIMUN VIII. My own MUN career began with hesitation and insecurities but after serving as delegate and student officer for the past years I have had the pleasure in approaching MUN in various perspectives. 
<br><br>
For nearly a decade, DIMUN has shown its commitment to excellence and professionalism in addition to fostering lifelong friendships between delegates. DIMUN has been a platform for developing public speaking and diplomacy skills and as the same time carries the belief in the virtues of multilateralism that are imperative in today’s world of diplomacy. 
<br><br>
As your Secretary-General, I will be devoted to providing a friendly and intellectual atmosphere for DIMUN VIII. I look forward to seeing what you have to bring to DIMUN and hope you enjoy a rewarding experience.

<br><br>
My name is Sunho Kwon, and it is my utmost honor to be serving as your Secretary General for this year’s DIMUN VIII conference. DIMUN provides an opportunity to all participants to foster both their global awareness and debating experience. Most importantly, DIMUN has been and will continue to be proud of its unique vibe of enthusiasm, which creates a welcoming atmosphere that nurtures the new delegates and acts as a space for close interaction and social activities between all participants. No matter how experienced you are and no matter where you are from, you will be able to reap a completely new experience and learn a valuable lesson from DIMUN. 
<br><br>
I started walking on the path of MUN 2 years ago. Starting as a delegate, I have faced countless challenges to overcome my shy personality. MUN was definitely the turning point of my life, where I completely changed my personality and fully developed as a leader. Above all, I can clearly remember all the conferences I have been through and all the people I have met. Every conference taught me something new, and I believed this unique experience had to be spread. This acted as a fuel to drive me forward and helped me take the final step. I am now here to assist leading DIMUN VIII, allowing all participants to go through the unique experience I was lucky enough to get.
<br><br>
Welcome to DIMUN VIII.

I am currently attending Year 11 at Dulwich College Beijing and have been involved in MUN for over two years. From debating resolutions as a delegate, to running committees as a chair, and finally to overseeing DIMUN as a member of the core team, I have thoroughly treasured and appreciated every moment of my MUN experience. It is my honor to serve you as your Deputy Secretary-General for DIMUN VIII and I hope we can work together to create an enjoyable and productive conference.

I am delighted to be part of the DIMUN VIII Student Executive Officer Team, and am honoured to be Secretary General of this year’s conference. Through my experiences in MUN, I have never failed to see the passion, diplomacy and enthusiasm of delegates. Whether they are debating or discussing in these conferences, I am eager to see the potential and skill that delegates have. It is indeed inspiring to see so many young people willing to tackle, resolve and have a further understanding of global issues. I look forward to meeting all the delegates, working with the directors, and be prepared to have a fruitful and meaningful conference.

<br><br>
it is an honour to be serving as your Head of Admin for this year’s DIMUN VIII conference. DIMUN is a place where great minds connect, great ideas flourish, and great memories are made. More importantly, DIMUN is a place where delegates learn more about what it means to be a citizen of the world. 
 <br><br>
Alongside my deputy, Jeffrey Liang, and the rest of the Admin Team, I will do everything I can to ensure that the conference runs as smoothly as possible. We hope to see you soon!

<br><br>
It is my upmost honor to be selected the Head of Press for DIMUN VIII. Being a member of the Press Team last year, I experienced the magic of DIMUN: watching young students dressed so smartly, talking about the future of the planet. Sitting in the room with these vibrant delegates and future world leaders has enabled me to learn so much too. 
 <br><br>
The Press Team will be responsible to produce three issues of the DIMUNITE magazine during the course of the conference. These magazines will include highlights from the day, articles published by experienced student-writers, as well as fun activities such as crosswords and word-searches. Our photographers will also be tirelessly taking photos that will be available on request for all the participating schools.
 <br><br>
Again, it is a huge honor to serve as this role, and I look forward to seeing you all!

     			Delegates: 
				<br>
				Delegates must be in Years 7 – 9 (Grades 6 – 8), and no previous MUN experience is necessary. However, high-school students who wish to join DIMUN VIII are welcome to join the Advisory Panel; a new committee that has been opened specially for interested high-school students. At the conference, each committee will have one delegate per country. 
				<br><br>
				Prior to the conference, delegates are required to research their assigned countries in order to represent them effectively in debate. They must also research their individual topics and prepare draft resolutions to be merged during lobbying. Delegates are also expected to be familiar with debate procedures, although committee Chairs will assist all delegates. Our Delegate Guide is available here and contains preparation and research guidelines, a sample resolution, the official DIMUN debate procedures and other relevant information.

           	Dulwich International Model United Nations was founded by Miranda Melcher and Benjamin Tan in 2010. Though we did not have the privilege of witnessing them build DIMUN from scratch, their initial resolve and ardour continues to inspire us today. The annual DIMUN conference serves to provide curious middle school students with the opportunity to discover and experience MUN from a young age. 
			<br><br>
			The rigid procedures and crowded committee rooms of MUN are not as apparent at DIMUN conferences; It’s a reminder of the basics of diplomacy: the simplest form of dialogue in order to achieve unanimity. DIMUN Delegates needn’t be seasoned, polished MUN debaters. We look for delegates who are not restricted by pre-conditioned approaches to global issues but have their original perspective, original perspectives that will become the foundation of tomorrow’s world. There will be no restraints at DIMUN: no judgement, no censorship, just opportunity. 
<br><br>
			DIMUN was created by Students, led by students and will continue to be led by students for many years to come. Our philosophy was shaped by the belief that each ‘generation’ of MUNers will inspire the next and advise them with their experience. The paths we pave now will make it easier for the next to discover their own. 
<br><br>
			Every Secretary-General, before and after me, pledge to guide, lead and stand to serve each participant of DIMUN, and I have faith that the legacy of DIMUN will continue to unreservedly serve the global community.

			The Dulwich International Model United Nations (DIMUN) conference was created to bring MUN to Key Stage 3 (KS3 or middle school) students in and around Northern China, as MUN opportunities for these students are limited. However, it quickly became apparent that while schools that already had KS4/5 MUN groups were able to add KS3 students, there were schools willing and eager to participate, but without any MUN experience. <br><br>
			While guides covering MUN debate rules, terminology, advice for delegates and Chairs are freely available on conference websites for participants, there is nothing out there to help schools go from having no MUN to attending a conference. Once a school has gone to one conference, going to future ones becomes much easier, as the preparation process is essentially the same for every conference. But that first conference is very difficult to attend without any MUN knowledge. <br><br>
			As the Director Model UN at Dulwich College Beijing for the past four years, with two years of MUN experience before that, I decided to take my knowledge of MUN and create the DIMUN conference. As I started attending MUN conferences as a KS3 student, I know first-hand that even delegates as young as 11 years old can fully participate in, appreciate, and learn a lot from MUN. However, aside from the MYMUN conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, KS3 conferences do not really exist. Thus, I created DIMUN. <br><br>
			Enjoy! <br><br>

			Miranda Melcher built our reputation from the ground up as a school known for its rigorous and rewarding MUN programme that, as a result of her leadership, is led purely by students. As such, this document serves particularly useful for student leaders in the same position that Miranda first found herself in 2009 as she began the process of building a sustainable and effective MUN programme, which has since grown from strength to strength.<br><br> 
			As my friend and mentor, I have had the pleasure to see Miranda push the boundaries of her own notable achievements through middle and high school, to only go on and inspire an entire generation of Dulwich students with her drive and expertise in MUN. The Dulwich International Model United Nations conference (DIMUN) was her brainchild and legacy, and so is this guide. This is a testament to her experience, commitment, and enthusiasm. Future MUN leaders have her to thank for years to come. <br><br>
