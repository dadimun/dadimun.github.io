					<p class="committeeTextIndent">
					<br>

					
					The security precautions related to computer information and access address four major threats. The first major threat is theft of data, such as that of military secrets from government computers. The second threat is vandalism, including the destruction of data by a computer virus. The third major threat is fraud, such as employees at a bank channeling funds into their own accounts; and finally, invasion of privacy, such as the illegal accessing of protected personal financial or medical data from a large database. Cyberspace and its underlying infrastructure are vulnerable to a wide range of risk stemming from both physical and cyber threats and hazards. Sophisticated cyber actors and nation-states exploit vulnerabilities to steal information and money and are developing capabilities to disrupt, destroy, or threaten the delivery of essential services. A range of traditional crimes are now being perpetrated through cyberspace. This includes the production and distribution of child pornography and child exploitation conspiracies, banking and financial fraud, intellectual property violations, and other crimes, all of which have substantial human and economic consequences.

					<p class="committeeTextIndent"><br>
					According to the Global Terrorism Index, the main driver of terrorism in recent years is due to
					religious extremism. The meaning of terrorism varies on many factors, but according to The
					Huffington Post, “a crime that is used as strategy or tactic in order to convey fear or terror” is
					the universally accepted definition. Unlike most crimes whose motives are often self-centered,
					the reason for terrorism is justified by excuses, such as, but not limited to political and religious
					reasons. Meanwhile, the term religious extremism is both subjective and self-explanatory: the
					fanatic belief in a political and/or religious cause, especially one who resorts to extreme actions
					such as, but not limited to martyrdom, the act of ending one’s own life to prove, stress, or
					defend a cause, which is an example of terrorism.

					</p>
					
					<p class="committeeTextIndent">
					<br>

					
					Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military. The military use of children, also known as “Children in armed conflicts”, takes three distinct ways: children can take direct part in hostilities as child soldiers; they can be used in support roles such as porters, spies, messengers, lookouts; or they can be used for political advantage as human shields or in propaganda. Girls may be forced into sexual slavery.
					The rise of extremist armed groups such as the Islamic State and Boko Haram has brought renewed attention to the plight of children—both as victims of abuses, and as fighters and militants. All too often, the concern and assistance governments offer abuse victims does not extend to those children caught up on the wrong side of the law or front line.

					</p><br>
               		<p class="committeeTextIndent">
               			In terms of producing electricity, there are several different methods to suit humanity’s needs.
						Environmentally friendly methods such as solar power plants, wind power plants, and hydroelectric
						dams are renewable, but often are expensive and rely on the environment. On the other hand, the usage
						of coal and oil may be inexpensive but lead to heavy taxing on the environment. Though expensive to
						construct, nuclear power plants are one of the most effective methods to produce energy, supplying
						11.5% of global electricity needs. Nuclear power plants are environmentally friendly, as they depend
						on the heat produced from the nuclear fission of uranium fuel pellets in order to boil water, which
						consequently powers a turbine, rather than the burning of fuels in order to create smoke. However, a
						byproduct of fission is nuclear waste, which comes in the form of highly radioactive liquid waste.
						These highly radioactive byproducts are also known as High-Level Waste (HLW), whose half-lives,
						the time that it takes for their
						radioactivity to fall to half the value, can range
						from ten thousand to two million years. The
						amount of energy used to manage and
						dispose of such nuclear waste takes up 5% of
						the total energy generated from nuclear power
						plants.

              		The first real cryptocurrencies first began in late 2008, with the creation of Bitcoin by Satoshi
					Nakamoto. It was a side invention of his “Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System”. He did this to
					circumvent the problems encountered by digital cash makers in the 90’s and the failures of the Trusted
					Third Party based system, a system in which a “trusted” centralized party oversees the transactions of
					currency. From there on, numerous other electronic currencies, such as Ethereum, were developed, and

					</p>
					
					<p class="committeeTextIndent">
					<br><br>
					Climate change has resulted in the significant growth of pathogens such as Perkinsusmarinus, a pathogen of the oyster Crassostreavirginica. There are different types of pathogens, but the most common types are bacteria, viruses, prions, protozoans, viroids, fungi, and human parasites. Research has revealed that there is a close tie between climate and pathogens, and have shown how the changes in the environment can affect the organisms which reside in it. The effects of climate change are tremendous, particularly in places such as jungles and rainforests where diverse creatures exist. For example, if the population of a plant species declines as a result of bacterial infections, organisms which depend on them as food sources will decline in population, followed by a decrease in carnivorous populations. Resurgence of pathogens is thus a threat to the world: not only do they affect the populations of wildlife, they also affect the whole population of humans.

					All species are an integral part of their ecosystems by performing functions that are essential to the maintenance of the environment. Not only do they affect the balance of the ecosystem, they play an important role economically in terms of food production, industry, and tourism. As the ocean is a complex three-dimensional world, home to 230,000 documented marine species, marine biodiversity is a field that is still poorly understood due to the vastness in size; there is still unexplored ocean terrain. Advancements in technology have both positive and negative impacts. It helps in discovering and classifying new species; however, it also pollutes the oceans. The effects on marine life are apparent, but are often overlooked due to the insufficient knowledge about aquatic terrain.

					<p class="committeeTextIndent">
					<br><br>
					The world already has experienced widespread damage caused by climate change disasters; sea levels and ocean temperatures are rising, and droughts are ruining agricultural production annually. For example, the increase in temperature has already decreased crop yields in southern Europe by reducing the number of available water resources as a result of extreme heat. Global warming – one of the largest aspects of climate change – is primarily caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide gas, which then become trapped in the earth’s lower atmospheric layer and accelerate the increase of the global temperature.

               		<p class="committeeTextIndent">

					Multinational companies play an important role in sustainable development, especially in developing countries. It is achieved through not only their direct activities that result in work opportunities and in increase in living standards, but all along their supply and distribution chains. The extent and impact of their activities on the environment within these developing countries is less well known. Though many multinationals have carried out impact assessments, evaluating their social and commercial impacts, the importance of earning profit for multinationals companies is still an issue, and often clashes with the goal of sustainable development.

					Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are enterprises that are managed from one (home) country but operate in a few countries. This topic will investigate on the measures to prevent these MNCs from exploiting developing markets in West Africa. This is because MNCs have immensely influenced developing countries, participating in their economic activity and growth. As MNCs influence developing countries, it is important to understand what effect MNCs have on these developing markets, how these MNCs benefit from developing markets, and why particular events happen.

						Hunger has always been an ever-present problem, and the rate of people starving has increased as inequalities expanded across the globe. Despite the efforts being made in recent years, food security is yet to be prioritized as a prominent problem. Today, approximately 795 million people are undernourished, which means nearly 1 in 9 people experience chronic hunger. 98% of the 795 million come from developing countries, where 1 out of 6 children are underweight. This is due to the presence of inadequate food distribution policies and unresolved issues of poverty in these countries. Poverty is an important cause of hunger, especially in impoverished villages where the citizens either do not have enough money to afford the basic necessities or have to use more than half of their income to do so. In addition, the antiquated urban market facilities in these regions further hinder the process of food distribution, aggravating food shortages. Although economic growth can alleviate food insecurity, it is important to understand that the underlying causes of this issue must be eradicated first in order to effectively solve this issue.

               		<p class="committeeTextIndent">
               		More than 5.5 million people below the age of 25 are unemployed in the European Union currently.
					Many of them are not even in education or training to further their skills and find job opportunities. Youth
					unemployment is steadily increasing as a rising number of young adults (aged 15-24) are transitioning
					from education to the labor market, causing a fierce increase in competition. Despite the fact that nearly
					100% of the population in the Eurozone go to school, once they hit the age of employment, a large
					percentage of them move into the labor market, rather than going to university, further exacerbating
					competition.

						violates fundamental human rights. Likewise, human trafficking in Southeast Asia has long been a

						trafficking are children. In Southeast Asia, child trafficking is widely regarded as interregional with
						laborers being collected from countries within the region and ultimately working within the region.
						Victims from Southeast Asia have also been found in many other countries around the globe. In Southeast
						Asia, child trafficking consists of forced sexual labor and forced labor which, in many countries in
						Southeast Asia, can lead to mixed forms of trafficking. For example, in Thailand and Malaysia,
						trafficking mainly takes the form of sexual exploitation, while in Indonesia forced labor is observed to be
						more prevalent, but both forms of sexual and forced labor can be found. It is estimated that 10,000
						laborers are deceived or captured into forced labor annually in the region.

					<p class="committeeTextIndent">
					Small arms and light weapons (SALW) are known to be fairly cheap compared to other
					classifications of guns. Due to the fact that SALWs are cheap and powerful, and can be easily
					operated, many regions and groups have chosen SALWs to be their primary weapon choice. The
					illicit trade of SALWs is a big issue in Africa. The civilian possession of SALWs is also a
					pressing issue in the United States of America; however, the US constitution’s second
					amendment gives the citizens “the right to keep and bear arms”. Hence, most of the SALWs
					traded in the US are not through illicit trading. The issue of the illicit trade of SALWs primarily
					affects Africa because SALWs are believed to be even cheaper than the necessities such as water
					or a sack of grain in Africa. As a result, SALWs can easily be possessed in Africa. The derisory
					control over trading of SALWs has led to its widespread and misuse; over time, SALWs have
					played a major role in armed crime. SALWs have become a major cause of insecurity in several
					countries.

					Due to their rich resources, the Polar Regions are attractive to countries. In order to maintain peace and security, the international community monitors the resources of Antarctica. The resources of Antarctica are protected under the Antarctic Treaty. Antarctica is one of the territories on earth that is not part of any recognized government. Antarctica is a continent that does not have permanent residents, as most of the people in Antarctica are part of a research mission or are tourists.

					In 1959, the Arctic Treaty System was established in order to prevent any wars from happening due to territorial disputes between countries. After this treaty was signed, there have not been any new claims when it came to the land in the Antarctic continent. The treaty states that Antarctica can only be used for peaceful and scientific purposes, not military purposes.

					With technology being on the rise in the recent years, chemical and biological weapons have been on the rise. These weapons are at risk of being acquired and used by non-state actors. Biological weapons are now available to non-state actors who can harm many civilians using these. Biological weapons are weapons that use harmful biological agents in order to cause death or disease to humans. In the future, taking into account the advancement of technology, bioterrorism poses a major threat especially in the hands of non-state actors. Biological weapons such as weaponized smallpox could possibly harm millions of civilians if they are exposed to these weapons.

					methods promoting collective security and sovereign equality the UN pursues the peaceful settlement of

               		Catalonia has been part of Spain since 1700’s, after the local government had supported and fought with
					an Austrian family that laid claim on parts of Spain. After losing the War of Spanish Succession,
					Catalonia was absorbed into the Kingdom of Spain and lost its autonomy for a while. Catalonia slowly
					became the center for industrialization within Spain over the course of the 18th then 19th century, due to
					their status as one of the few regions that survived the Napoleonic occupation and the War in Spain.
					However, when the Second Spanish Republic was defeated in 1939, Catalonia and the rest of Spain
					suffered economic boycotts and other such sanctions. All of this led to Catalonia’s fall from grace as a
					beacon of economic prosperity to being one of the poorer regions within Spain. It took nearly four
					decades before the “Spanish Miracle”, which occurred in 1974, when the Spanish government rebuilt the
					Spanish tourist industry which then bolstered economic growth throughout Spain. In 1978, the Spanish
					government introduced a new Democratic Constitution which recognized Catalonia as an autonomous
					region with its own language.
